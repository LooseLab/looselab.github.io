# Lab Home Page

We're going to use these pages to report on software and papers as well as incremental updates to software and tools.

For issues on software please use our github repositories as appropriate.

Our lab is based at the [University of Nottingham](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk) in the [School of Life Sciences](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/life-sciences).

  Constantly under construction!

In our lab we work on a range of questions with a whole host of great collaborators. 

If you want to find out more then get in touch - easiest way is to do that is via twitter - [@mattloose](http://www.twitter.com/mattloose).

If you find an office phone number it's unlikely to get answered. Emails sometimes work - if you don't get a quick response feel free to try again (and sorry!). 

Current active projects that will be (or are) discussed on this site include:

* [ReadFish](http://www.github.com/looselab/readfish)

ReadFish are our advanced tools for adaptive sequencing (or read until) using [Oxford Nanopore](https://www.nanoporetech.com) sequencers. You can learn more about ReadFish in our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.926956v2). Future applications and uses for adaptive sequencing are described in our collaborative work with Nick Goldman, Ewan Birney and colleages [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.938670v2).

* [BulkVis](http://www.github.com/looselab/bulkvis)

BulkVis enables visualisation of raw signal data from Oxford Nanopore Sequencing Runs - the tools include methods for spotting whales... 🐳...🐳..🐋...🐋..🐳...🐳
